    - No additional permissions needed
  - On Linux:
    - May require `xhost` access depending on your distribution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibttf/interview-coder.git
cd interview-coder
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if using bun
bun install
```

## Running Locally

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run app:dev
# or
bun run app:dev
```

This will:

- Start the Vite development server
- Launch the Electron application
- Enable hot-reloading for development

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run app:build
# or
bun run app:build
```

The built application will be available in the `release` directory.

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- OpenAI API

## Configuration

1. On first launch, you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key
2. The application will store your settings locally using electron-store
